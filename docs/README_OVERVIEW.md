# Welcome Young Coder!

This project sets up a Minecraft server where you can someday run **Python** code (and also normal Java plugins).

Right now it gives you:
- A place to drop the Paper server jar (the Minecraft server software)
- A pretend Java plugin called *PythonBridge* (later it could talk to Python)
- A sample Python plugin folder so you learn structure
- Scripts to start the server and make a Python virtual environment
- A fun example Java plugin **BoomBarnyard** that makes pigs & chickens explode when they die

New! A **starter bridge** between Java and Python. Read `BRIDGE_DESIGN.md` to see how join events get sent to Python.

Want to start? Read `SETUP_GUIDE.md` next.
